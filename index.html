                <h1>In no less than three weeks I did away with my gray hair, and hair color was restored. A recipe that I am glad to share with whoever is interested.</h1>
                <p>I remember I talked about finding a gray hair on my head at some point. I wasn’t at all comfortable with it but I found consolation in the fact that I couldn’t avoid it at my age. But recently the gray hair had taken over almost half of my head, it was worrisome.</p>
                <p>I booked appointments with a doctor who all he had to say was “I’m 56 and it"s expected that I have gray hair and there was nothing he could do to assist me”</p>
                <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  ><img height="300px" width="700px" src="assets/images/inner1.png" alt=""></a>
                <p>So I thought to myself, guess I’m going to start <b>applying dye on my hair</b>! And as one who had never applied dye on my hair ever before, it was quite the challenge trying to understand what I wanted from a lot of hair color products out there. So many there are, each which its different effects, some of which don’t even  <b>cover gray hair</b>. And I was well aware of the fact that even if I applied a dye with the best quality, I would need to repeat to the procedure in about two to three weeks as a non-fan of the gray hair.</p>
                <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  ><img src="assets/images/inner2.jpeg" alt=""></a>
                <p>Still trying to make a decision, I went on the internet in search of some reviews. As I kept on with my search through the millions of forums and advertisements, I came across <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  >websites for an innovative product</a>  that promise  <b>hair color restoration</b>. Take note that this isn’t a dye, but rather a special type of hairspray that supposedly promotes a production  <b>of melanin, which is a substance behind the natural pigmentation of the hair</b>. When gray hair starts to surface, it is due to lack of melanin in the roots of the hair.</p>
                <p>So instead of applying dye that could end up <b>ruining my hair structure</b> I opted to make an <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  >order</a> that spray.  for the spray. At the time of the order, they had a discount for it and the price, very affordable.</p>
                <p> In a weeks’ time I received my order;</p>
                <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  ><img src="assets/images/product.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <p>I was quite consistent with the usage, making use of it on the second day after I wash my hair, I would spray it all over my hair as it was starting to dry and then finish up with styling the hair the normal way I did.</p>
                <p>The first week passed and I didn’t see any effect. I wasn’t bothered, I mean it"s only the first week, it would take some time I thought, knowing that <b>it wasn’t any type of dye</b>. To my greatest surprise, in the second week I noticed that the roots of my hair appeared much darker, like about a quarter of the hair was dark and the rest of it still gray. It appeared as if the color was slowly spreading through the hair. In a month’s time, I got my original chestnut hair color back.</p>
                <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  ><img src="assets/images/inner4.jpg" alt=""></a>
                <p>All it took was one month, two bottles of the spray and I am glad I used it! I can look in the mirror and find it hard to believe that I am 56 years of age. Take a look, do I look 56?</p>
                <p>I would advise the ladies not to be in a hurry to use dyes, <b> if you see that you are developing grey hair and are not ok with it, then try the spray </b>!  In my opinion, I think it would work a lot faster during the early stages because in my case I had quite a lot of damage already. I still think it would work out too for a </b>completely covered gray hair</b>, the difference is it might take longer.</p>
                <p>The name of the spray is <b>Colour Keep</b>,  it can be ordered online from the <a  href="#" onclick="fbPixel();return false;"  >official supplier’s website</a>.</p>
                <p>If there is anyone who has had an experience using that spray, please share! We would like to know if it worked out for you as it did for me.</p>
                <p>Wishing you all the best, Stay healthy, young and beautiful!!!</p>
